# Step 1 – Explanation: Project Setup

## 🧱 Why Vite?

- Vite is a build tool and development server that is fast and lightweight.
- It is designed to replace older tools like Create React App (CRA).
- Offers **hot module reloading**, fast dev experience, and ES module support.

## 🎨 Why Tailwind CSS?

- Utility-first CSS framework that lets you style directly in JSX (`className`).
- Easily switch between dark/light modes.
- Great for customizable and scalable dashboards.
- Future-proof: we'll allow clients to customize themes later via Tailwind tokens or CSS overrides.

## ⚛️ Why React?

- Component-based, great for dynamic interfaces like dashboards.
- Easy integration with routing, API calls, and conditional views (e.g. RBAC).
- Supported by massive community and modern tooling.

## ✅ Dev Environment

- We’re using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Node.js installed system-wide
- All packages handled by `npm`

## 🧭 What’s Next?

We’ll start working on:
1. Routing setup using React Router
2. Creating the main **layout** with Sidebar + Topbar
3. Setting up component structure for pages (Accounts, Trades, History, etc.)

This sets the stage for role-based rendering, theming, and embedding future content like Power BI reports.
