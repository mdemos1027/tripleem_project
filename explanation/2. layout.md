# Step 2 â€“ Explanation

## Why Routing?
Allows SPA (single-page app) navigation between views like Dashboard, Trades, etc.

## Why Layout Component?
Every page shares common UI (sidebar + topbar). We wrap them with `<Outlet />` for dynamic page injection.

## Why This Structure?
- `pages/` keeps views clean
- `components/` holds reusable UI
- `layout/` wraps pages with structure

## Whatâ€™s Next?
1. Add **Authentication** (fake login, context-based)
2. Add **Role-Based Views** (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
3. Add **Theme toggle (Dark/Light)**
